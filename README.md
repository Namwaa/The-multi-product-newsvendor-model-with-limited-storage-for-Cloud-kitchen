The objective of this research is to find the optimal quantity for a restaurant in a Cloud kitchen to achieve highest profits. Since a Cloud kitchen typically provides limited raw materials storage, a restaurant needs to plan order quantity properly before knowing the actual demand of each menu. We studied the proper and accurate sales forecasting techniques and used the one that gives the lowest RMSE value to forecast the sales for each menu. Then, we applied the Newsvendor model to find the appropriate quantity of raw materials purchasing that resulted in the highest expected total profit under each raw materials constraint and compared the total profit between the current raw materials purchase policy and the new policy from the model. The study result showed that the new approach would increase the average total profit by about 8,506.44 baht per day, or 78.59% of the current policy.
